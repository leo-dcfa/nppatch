# ADR-0002: Include Record Types in Package

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-10

## Context

NPSP's 1GP packages included record types in `unpackaged/pre/` directories, meaning they were deployed to the packaging org but not actually included in the distributed package. Subscribers would get these through the trial/dev org configuration or need to create them manually.

For 2GP unlocked packages, record types on standard objects (Account, Opportunity) CAN be included in the package. The question was whether to:

1. Continue the 1GP pattern (not package them)
2. Include them in the 2GP package
3. Create them via post-install script

Several tests expected specific record types to exist (HH_Account, Donation, Grant, etc.) and were failing due to missing record types.

## Decision

Include record types in the 2GP package source:

**Account Record Types:**
- HH_Account (Household Account)
- Organization

**Opportunity Record Types:**
- Donation
- Grant
- InKindGift
- MajorGift
- MatchingGift
- Membership

Each record type includes associated business process (using standard stages per ADR-0001) and picklist value mappings.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Tests pass without requiring manual org setup
- Subscribers get working record types out of the box
- Consistent experience across installations
- Package is more self-contained

### Negative
- Subscribers who don't want these record types have extra metadata
- Must maintain record type definitions in source control

### Unlocked Package Flexibility
Because this is an **unlocked** package (not managed), subscribers CAN:
- Delete record types they don't need
- Modify record type configurations
- Add their own record types

This flexibility mitigates concerns about forcing unwanted record types on subscribers.
