# Recurring Donations

The Enhanced Recurring Donations (RD2) feature provides comprehensive management of commitments from donors who give repeatedly over time. The system automates opportunity creation, tracks payment schedules, manages recurring donation status, and logs all changes for audit purposes.

## Overview

Recurring donations in nppatch represent ongoing financial commitments from contacts or accounts. Unlike opportunities that represent single transactions, recurring donations automatically generate installment opportunities at defined intervals, supporting both flexible and structured donation schedules.

### Key Concepts

- **Recurring Donation**: A record representing an ongoing commitment to donate
- **Installment Period**: The frequency at which donations occur (monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.)
- **Schedule**: The calculated dates and amounts for future donations based on the installment period
- **Donor Type**: Either Account (organizational) or Contact (individual) relationship
- **Sustainer Status**: Automatic tracking of active recurring donors for engagement analysis

## Recurring Donation Configuration

### Installment Periods and Frequency

The system supports multiple installment periods through the `RD2_Constants` class:

| Period | Frequency | Examples |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Monthly | Every month | 12 donations per year |
| Quarterly | Every 3 months | 4 donations per year |
| Annually | Every 12 months | 1 donation per year |
| Weekly | Every 7 days | ~52 donations per year |
| Every 2 Weeks | Every 14 days | ~26 donations per year |

### Day-of-Month Scheduling

For monthly and quarterly donations, the system supports day-of-month selection:

- **Specific Day** (1-28): Donation created on that day each period
- **Last Day of Month**: Automatically adjusts for months with fewer days (e.g., February 28/29)
- **Custom Interval**: Configurable days between installments

### Recurring Donation Fields

Recurring donations track:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Amount__c` | The donation amount per installment |
| `Day_of_Month__c` | The day each month/quarter donations occur |
| `Installment_Frequency__c` | How many installments per period (e.g., 1 per month, 2 per month) |
| `Installment_Period__c` | The period for installments (monthly, quarterly, etc.) |
| `Status__c` | Current state (Active, Paused, Closed, Lapsed) |
| `StartDate__c` | When the recurring donation begins |
| `EndDate__c` | Optional end date for the commitment |
| `Planned_Installments__c` | Total expected donation count (null = indefinite) |
| `Recurring_Type__c` | Fixed (same amount) or Open (variable amount) |

## Schedule Management

The `RecurringDonationSchedule__c` object stores calculated schedules for easy opportunity lookup and forecasting:

### Schedule Records

For each recurring donation, the system generates schedule records containing:

- **Installment Number**: Sequential count (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Scheduled Opportunity Close Date**: When the opportunity should close
- **Planned Opportunity Amount**: Expected donation amount
- **Status**: Scheduled, Paid, Overdue, or Skipped

### Automatic Opportunity Creation

The system automatically creates opportunities on recurring donations through:

1. **Evaluation Logic**: `RD2_OpportunityEvaluation_BATCH` evaluates each recurring donation against its schedule
2. **Gap Detection**: Identifies missing opportunities between last created and next expected
3. **Bulk Creation**: Generates opportunities for all due recurring donations in a batch job
4. **Field Mapping**: Maps recurring donation fields to opportunity fields (amount, close date, stage, etc.)

### Opportunity Naming

Opportunities created from recurring donations follow a naming convention:

- Pattern: `[Donor Name] [Installment #] - [Close Date]`
- Example: `Acme Corp 5 - 2024-05-31`

## Status and State Management

### Status vs. State

The system distinguishes between:

- **Status**: User-visible state (Active, Paused, Closed, Lapsed)
- **State**: Internal tracking state for evaluation (includes intermediate values)

### Status Transitions

| From Status | To Status | Trigger |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Active | Paused | User action or automation |
| Active | Closed | User sets end date |
| Paused | Active | User resumes |
| Active | Lapsed | Auto-detection (e.g., no opportunity created when expected) |

### Status-to-State Mapping

The `RecurringDonationStatusMapping__mdt` custom metadata type maps user-visible statuses to internal states for opportunity creation evaluation. This allows organizations to customize which statuses should:

- Trigger automatic opportunity creation
- Prevent further opportunities
- Allow manual opportunity entry only

## Change Logging

The system provides complete audit trails through the `RecurringDonationChangeLog__c` object:

### Tracked Changes

Every modification to a recurring donation records:

- **Field Changed**: Which field was modified
- **Old Value**: Previous value
- **New Value**: New value
- **Change Type**: Create, Update, Status Change, Schedule Change
- **Timestamp**: When the change occurred

### Change Log Viewer UI

The `rd2ChangeLog` Lightning Web Component displays change history with:

- Chronological list of all changes
- Field-level detail (old value to new value)
- Change reason if provided
- User who made the change

### RD2_ChangeView Class

Server-side controller providing:

- `getChanges(Id recurringDonationId)`: Retrieves change log records
- Filtering by change type
- Formatting for display

## Recurring Donations Settings

Configuration through `Recurring_Donations_Settings__c`:

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Enhanced Recurring Donations Enabled | Activates RD2 vs. legacy system |
| Change Log Enabled | Enables automatic change tracking |
| Auto-Create Opportunities | Enables automatic opportunity generation |
| Default Installment Period | Default period when creating new RD |
